# JRE Scribe Transcripts
Full transcripts for the Joe Rogan Experience podcast utilized in a VuePress site. https://jrescribe.com/

## Contributing

1. When updating a transcript, be sure to make use of [markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/) and not HTML.
2. Try to pay attention to the `<timemark />` components to make sure the seconds are aligned w/ the audio as closely as possible.
3. Be aware that there are a handful of custom Vue components that may be useful: `<timemark />, more soon ...`



#### Background
These markdown files are integrated into a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org) site.

This means that there is support for [markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/) as well as some [VueJS](vuejs.org) capabilities (Interpolation, Directives, Components and more).

If you have ideas for improvements in either of these areas, be sure to [open an issue](https://github.com/achendrick/jrescribe-transcripts/issues) so I can expand on the features.
